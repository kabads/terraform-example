# terraform-example
This is a basic script to get resources on AWS to run a simple http server

All the variables are defined in variables.tf and the resources are defined in examples.tf.

TODO - define more specific architecture in variables.tf.

A third file called terraform.tfvars should hold sensitive variables (such as your access key and secrets).
